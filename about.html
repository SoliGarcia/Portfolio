        I am a current student at the College of Western Idaho. My major of study is software development. I also have a Bachlor's degree in Psychology, which I would like to share that I am deeply passionate about helping people live their lives to the fullest despite any limitations they may have, whether it is physically or mentally.

        I've always had an interest in coding since I took an Advanced Computer Science class in high school. There is where I first learned to create a very basic clicker game aa well as create a small song that uses pre-recorded instrumental sounds using code to assign where and when instruments should play, for how long, and what tempo they should be at.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you may be wondering, why the career change? Well, I plan to combime both my knowledge of psychology and software development in the hopes to create software that can help improve the quality of life for everyone who needs it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is much I may not understand now but I am a quick learner who wants to improve everday, in hope to use what I know to help others. Do continue to look into my projects that I've done, the skills I have to offer, and what my education has taught me.
